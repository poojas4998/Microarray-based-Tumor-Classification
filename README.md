project-1-programmer.R - Script written for data preprocessing & quality control. It can be executed using the R console or an integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio. The programmer also added it as .rmd and knitted the report to html (project-1-programmer.rmd, project-1-programmer.html). All of this is in the programmer_scripts folder.  

Proj_1_Analyst.R - Script written for noise filtering, dimensionality reduction, hierarchical clustering and subtype discovery. It can be executed using the R console or an integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio.

biologist_script.R - Script written to identify top 10 up- and down-regulated probesets with gene symbol, t-statistic, nominal p-value, and adjusted p-value columns;  and identify top 3 enriched gene sets for each geneset type. It can be executed using the R console or an integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio.
